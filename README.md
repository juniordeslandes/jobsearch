# jobsearch

This is a personal project in which I began working with PHP and the Symfony 2 framework to develop a program that fetches 
and merges into a single file the job descriptions from the numerous job alert emails I have setup. My goals were:
- to reduce the number of clicks I had to do before actually reaching the descriptions of the jobs
- eliminate doubles (same job offering appearing multiple times from same job alert email or in different sources)
- eliminate extraneous information (introduction about the company, etc.)
